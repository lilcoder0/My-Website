            I created an animation story, which was a conversation story,
            talking about the way coding is an activity to do and how it also
            helps in someone's life or day-to-day activities. When making the
            projects, I learned how to be patient, and I also discovered that
            one can face many challenges in activities that look easy to do. I
            also created a game app, which was a maze and quiz game - two games
            mixed together. You first had to answer the questions at the quiz
            game and get 50% or above to play the maze game. It was really fun
            creating those projects during the holiday.

          <p>
            I am currently studying at Premese Greenhill School. I like my
            school because it has very nice teachers who take care of us and
            educate us well. They also guide us and help us through challenges.
            I like my class because my classmates are helpful and kind. We learn
            a lot from each other and support each other during different
            hardships, challenges, or situations.

            I like reading. I like reading because it helps me learn new and
            different vocabulary. I also like cycling. I like it because it's
            fun and keeps me busy for a long time. I also create rap lyrics and
            rap when I'm bored. Rapping is my talent and also my hobby, and I
            love doing it.
